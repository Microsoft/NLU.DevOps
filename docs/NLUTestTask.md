# NLU CI/CD with NLUTest Azure Pipelines task

To test an NLU model, add the following configuration to your pipeline:
```yaml
- task: NLUTest@0
  inputs:
    service: luis
    utterances: path/to/tests.json
    publishTestResults: true
```

The [`utterances`](#utterances) input should be a path to a JSON file with labeled [generic utterances](GenericUtterances.md), relative to the [`workingDirectory`](#workingdirectory). You may also use the [LUIS batch test](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-concept-batch-test#batch-file-format) format, as we also recognize `startPos` and `endPos` for resolving the `matchText` and `matchIndex` from the generic utterances model.

To test with speech WAV files, set the [`speech`](#speech) input to `true` and, optionally, set the base directory for the speech files with the [`speechDirectory`](#speechdirectory) input, if the `speechFile` property for each generic utterance is not relative to the [`workingDirectory`](#workingdirectory). For more information about running NLU tests from speech, take a look at the [docs](Test.md#getting-started-with-speech) on NLU.DevOps.

Setting `publishTestResults` to `true` will run your test utterances against the NLU provider and compare the results against the details in the [`utterances`](#utterances) input. It outputs failing tests for any false positive or false negative intents or entities. It outputs passing tests for any true positive or true negative intents or entities.

For reference, here is an example run of [NLU test results](https://dev.azure.com/NLUDevOps/NLU.DevOps/_build/results?buildId=574&view=ms.vss-test-web.build-test-results-tab).

See the endpoint configuration documentation for [LUIS](LuisEndpointConfiguration.md), [Lex](LexEndpointConfiguration.md), and [Dialogflow](DialogflowEndpointConfiguration.md) for more information on required and optional pipeline variables to set for the `NLUTest` task.

Inputs to consider when using the `NLUTest` task:
- [`service`](#service)
- [`utterances`](#utterances)
- [`modelSettings`](#modelsettings)
- [`speech`](#speech)
- [`speechDirectory`](#speechdirectory)
- [`output`](#output)
- [`compareOutput`](#compareoutput)
- [`publishTestResults`](#publishtestresults)
- [`publishNLUResults`](#publishnluresults)
- [`workingDirectory`](#workingdirectory)
- [`nupkgPath`](#nupkgpath)
- [`toolVersion`](#toolversion)

## Inputs

### `service`

Required. Specifies the NLU provider to use when deleting the model. Works for `luis`, `luisV3`, `dialogflow` and `lex`.

### `utterances`

Required. Specifies the path to the labeled test utterances relative to the [`workingDirectory`](#workingdirectory).

### `modelSettings`

Optional. Specifies the path to the model settings, relative to the [`workingDirectory`](#workingdirectory). Currently only used for [LUIS prebuilt entity mappings](LuisModelConfiguration.md#configuring-prebuilt-entities).

### `speech`

Optional. Specifies whether the tests should be run from speech utterances instead of text utterances. Default value is `false`.

### `speechDirectory`

Optional. Specifies the base path for speech files referenced in the [`utterances`](#utterances) input, relative to the [`workingDirectory`](#workingdirectory).

### `output`

Optional. Specifies the output path for the results from testing the NLU model, relative to the [`workingDirectory`](#workingdirectory). Defaults to `$(Agent.TempDirectory)/.nlu/results.json`.

### `compareOutput`

Optional. Specifies the output path for the results from comparing the NLU model test results to the expected output in the [`utterances`](#utterances) input, relative to the [`workingDirectory`](#workingdirectory). Defaults to `$(Agent.TempDirectory)/.nlu`.

### `publishTestResults`

Optional. Boolean value that specifies whether the comparison results between the NLU model output and the [`utterances`](#utterances) input should be published to the Tests tab for the Azure Pipeline. Defaults to `false`.

### `publishNLUResults`

Optional. Boolean value that specifies whether the comparison results should output metadata for the confusion matrix for intents, entities and text. Defaults to `false`.

### `workingDirectory`

Optional. Specifies the working directory to use when running the `test` command. Defaults to the Azure DevOps default working directory (i.e., the root directory of the repository).

### `nupkgPath`

Optional. Specifies the folder containing a `.nupkg` for `dotnet-nlu` to install from. When not specified, `dotnet-nlu` is installed from the default NuGet repository.

### `toolVersion`

Optional. Specifies the version of `dotnet-nlu` to install from the default NuGet repository. You cannot specify both the [`nupkgPath`](#nupkgpath) input and `toolVersion`.
